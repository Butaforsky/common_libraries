 *
 *      The object of this PollingRoutine.c/h files is to not have to write code in main.c which already has a lot of generated code.
 *      It is cumbersome having to scroll through all the generated code for your own code and having to find a USER CODE section so your code is not erased when CubeMX re-generates code.
 *      
 *      Direction: Call PollingInit before the main while loop. Call PollingRoutine from within the main while loop
 * 
 *      Example;
        // USER CODE BEGIN WHILE
        PollingInit();
        while (1)
        {
            PollingRoutine();
            // USER CODE END WHILE

            // USER CODE BEGIN 3
        }
        // USER CODE END 3
